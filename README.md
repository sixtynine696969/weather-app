## TODO
1. parse time from wetherAPI and display it in samsung wether app format - done, though it needs to be somehow interpolated with current time since wetherAPI data is bit hehind (take hours and month from wtherAPI and interpolate new Date() time) or figure something else out</br>
2. copy samsung wether app rows and display UV etc data.
