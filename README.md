## TODO
1. parse time from wetherAPI and display it in samsung wether app format - done, though it needs to be somehow interpolated with current time since wetherAPI data is bit hehind (take hours and month from wtherAPI and interpolate new Date() time)</br>
2. copy samsung wether app rows and display UV etc data.
